This graph explains the solar wind's effects on Earth's magnetosphere. Scientists have discovered that the most intense effects upon Earth's magnetic field occur when the solar wind magnetic field is directed opposite to Earth's magnetic field and the intensity is 'large'. <br><br>When the solar wind magnetic field is opposite the Earth's, it is called a southward field and is considered to be negative in sign. The measuring unit is the nano-Tesla (nT), which is a unit of magnetic strength. The 'Bz\" component, the second plot from the top and labeled in yellow, is the one that carries information about the North-South part of the solar wind magnetic field. This component is how we classify storms. If the Bz is between +3nT and +5nt, that is low; if the Bz values jump up and are between +20nT and +40nT, that is considered extreme.</p>]]></description>
