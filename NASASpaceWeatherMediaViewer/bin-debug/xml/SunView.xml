					<description><![CDATA[<p><font size="24"><img src="assets/images/aia193.png" width="150" height="150" align="right"></img>The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is designed to provide an unprecedented view of the solar corona, taking images that span at least 1.3 solar diameters in multiple wavelengths nearly simultaneously, at a resolution of about 1 arcsec and at a cadence of 10 seconds or better.  <br><br>The primary goal of the AIA Science Investigation is to use this data, together with data from other SDO instruments and from other observatories, to significantly improve our understanding of the physics behind the activity displayed by the Sun's atmosphere, which drives space weather in the heliosphere and in planetary environments. Solar activity is driven by the evolving magnetic field.<br><br> Although the coronal magnetic field cannot be measured directly, much of the magnetic field within 10^5 km from the surface contains hot plasma that is dense enough to emit detectable levels of light. This plasma is (mostly) frozen onto the field lines, so that the emission from (or absorption by) the plasma outlines the magnetic field. <br><br>The coronal plasma has a wide range of temperatures, emitting brightest at EUV and soft X-ray wavelengths. A suitably designed imager with narrow thermal responses, such as the AIA, can use these contrasts to dissect the corona into complementary sets of high-contrast images for further analysis. <br><br>A coronal hole is a region of the Sun's corona that appears dark in pictures taken with a coronagraph or during a total solar eclipse, and that shows up as a void in X-ray and extreme ultraviolet images. Coronal holes are of very low density (typically 100 times lower than the rest of the corona) and have an open magnetic field structure, extending indefinitely into space rather than looping back into the photosphere. This open structure allows charged particles to escape from the Sun and results in coronal holes being the primary source of the solar wind and the exclusive source of its high-speed component. During the minimum years of the solar cycle, coronal holes are largely confined to the Sun's polar regions, while at solar maximum, they can open up at any latitudes.</p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><font size="24"><img src="assets/images/aia304.png" width="150" height="150" align="right"></img>The AIA 304 analyzes solar prominences. A prominence is a large, bright feature extending outward from the Sun's surface, often in a loop shape. Prominences are anchored to the Sun's surface in the photosphere, and extend outwards into the Sun's corona. While the corona consists of extremely hot ionized gases, known as plasma, which do not emit much visible light, prominences contain much cooler plasma, similar in composition to that of the chromosphere. A prominence forms in about a day, and stable prominences may persist in the corona for several months. Some prominences break apart and give rise to coronal mass ejections. Scientists are currently researching how and why prominences are formed.</p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><font size="24"><img src="assets/images/aia171.png" width="150" height="150" align="right"></img>Coronal Loops are analyzed through data from the AIA 171. Coronal loops form the basic structure of the lower corona and transition region of the Sun. These highly structured loops are a direct consequence of the twisted solar magnetic flux within the solar body. The population of coronal loops can be directly linked with the solar cycle; it is for this reason that coronal loops are often found with sunspots at their footpoints. The upwelling magnetic flux pushes through the photosphere, exposing the cooler plasma below. The contrast between the photosphere and solar interior gives the impression of dark spots, or sunspots.</p>]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[<p><font size="24"><img src="assets/images/HMI.png" width="150" height="150" align="right"></img>HMI is an instrument designed to study oscillations and the magnetic field at the solar surface, or photosphere. HMI is one of three instruments on the Solar Dynamics Observatory; together, the suite of instruments observes the Sun nearly continuously and takes a terabyte of data a day. HMI observes the full solar disk at 6173 Ã… with a resolution of 1 arcsecond. <br><br>HMI is a successor to the Michelson Doppler Imager on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory.  The magnetogram or magnetic image of the Sun shows the magnetic field in the solar photosphere. The black and white shading indicates opposite polarities. Using technology similar to that of a radar gun, it maps the charge and direction of movement towards or away from the viewer of plasma around the active regions.</p>]]></description>

This spacecraft, one of two identical spacecraft, is trailing behind Earth, basically along the Earth's orbit path.  As it falls further behind, it can see more and more of the Sun, so that we can tell what solar features exist even before the Sun's rotation brings them into view from an Earth (and SOHO's) perspective. <br><br>The color is just an identifying tint added to the original image in black and white. The color table was carefully constructed to bring out typical features of its particular wavelength.  Images are taken every few minutes and updated online within an hour of their being taken.  The images exist only at a lower resolution and zooming in on them too closely will cause distortion.  In extreme UV light, active regions appear almost white and coronal holes appear very dark.

H-Alpha images are taken in the red portion of the visible spectrum.  Depending on the activity of the Sun you may be able to see dark sunspots and bright \"plage\".  These appear in areas of strong magnetic field, which correspond to the active areas that you may see in the Extreme Ultraviolet images.  You also ofton see long, dark \"filaments\", which appear as bright \"prominences\" on the limb.  These sometimes erupt and can be parts of coronal mass ejections.</p>]]></description>
