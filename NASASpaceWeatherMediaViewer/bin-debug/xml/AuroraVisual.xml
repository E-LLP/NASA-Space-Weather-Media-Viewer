This animation shows the visible aurora in the Northern Hemisphere on July 16, 2000. The data comes from the Visible Imaging System (VIS) on board the NASA Polar spacecraft.

		<description><![CDATA[<p><font size="24"><img src="assets/images/Aurora-Curtain.png" width="150" height="150" align="right"></img>An aurora is a beautiful pattern of light.  The lights appear to be a billowing curtain blowing in the wind. No two auroras are alike. When you see an aurora, you know that we are having a Sun-Earth Connection event.  We know that all the energy from the Sun is being harnessed in our own atmosphere, and is causing great amounts of energy to flow around our near space atmosphere.  This aurora was caused by a CME.
